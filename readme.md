# Solve the dynamics of laminated plates using a modified Ritz approach

This repository is the implementation of the approach given by paper [1]. 
The vibration of the plate is solved by using a modified Ritz approach, where
general boundary conditions are taken into account.

The implementation of the method is provided as the package `plate`. The data and figures in the paper are generated by python scripts starting with `example` in the project root and all the figures can be found in `/figures`.

To run the code, Python version >= 3.8 is required and additional packages such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and `sympy` are also necessary.
